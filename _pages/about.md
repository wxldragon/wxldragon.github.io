I am currently a second-year master's student in the _[School of Cyber Science and Engineering](https://cse.hust.edu.cn/)_ at _[Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/)_, Wuhan, China,
supervised by [Professor Shengshan Hu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=lkAFwJgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) from [TAI group](http://trustai.cse.hust.edu.cn/). Prior to that, I obtained a Bachelor of Engineering degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2022.

My current research interest focuses on **_trustworthy AI, embodied AI, AIGC, and etc._**. I am always open for any research communication and cooperation, please don't hesitate to contact me if you are interested.
