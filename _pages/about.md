I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the _[Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/)_ at _[City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/)_, supervised by _[Chair Professor Xiaohua JIA (IEEE Fellow)](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~jia/)_. Prior to that, I earned a B.E. degree from _[Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/)_ in June 2022, and obtained a M.E. degree from _[Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/)_ in June 2025, supervised by _[Professor Shengshan Hu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=lkAFwJgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao)_ of the _[TAI group](http://trustai.cse.hust.edu.cn/)_. 
My research interest focuses on **_Trustworthy LLM, Trustworthy Embodied AI, Unlearnable Examples, Backdoor/Poison Learning_**. I am always open for any research communication and cooperation, please don't hesitate to contact me if you are interested.
